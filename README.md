# phaseR

**phaseR** a qualitative analysis of one- and two-dimensional autonomous
ODE systems, using phase plane methods. Programs are available to
identify and classify equilibrium points, plot the direction field, and
plot trajectories for multiple initial conditions. In the
one-dimensional case, a program is also available to plot the phase
portrait. Whilst in the two-dimensional case, programs are additionally
available to plot nullclines and stable/unstable manifolds of saddle
points. Many example systems are provided for the user.

## Installation

You can install the released version of **phaseR** from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("phaseR")
```

Alternatively, the latest development version available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/) can be installed with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("mjg211/phaseR")
```
