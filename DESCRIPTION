Description: Performs a qualitative analysis of one- and two-dimensional
   autonomous ODE systems, using phase plane methods. Programs are available to
   identify and classify equilibrium points, plot the direction field, and plot
   trajectories for multiple initial conditions. In the one-dimensional case, a 
   program is also available to plot the phase portrait. Whilst in the
   two-dimensional case, programs are additionally available to plot nullclines
   and stable/unstable manifolds of saddle points. Many example systems are
   provided for the user.
